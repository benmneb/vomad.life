<prominent-img src="forever-changed/animalliberation" alt="Animal Liberation by Peter Singer -  Books To Help You Stay Vegan for Life" caption=""></prominent-img>

_**Main topics:** Philosophy, ethics, animal agriculture._

Singer's first book has been called "**the most important document on animal welfare ever written**" by the Guardian Newspaper in the UK.

Since its original publication in 1975, this groundbreaking work has awakened millions of concerned men and women to the shocking abuse of animals everywhere -- inspiring a worldwide movement to eliminate much of the cruel and unnecessary laboratory animal experimentation of years past.

An important and persuasive appeal to conscience, fairness, decency and justice, Animal Liberation is essential reading for the supporter and the skeptic alike.

Recommended for those interested in **ethics and animal rights**.

_by Melanie Joy, PhD_

<prominent-img src="forever-changed/whywelovedogs" alt="Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs & Wear Cows by Melanie Joy - Books To Help You Stay Vegan for Life"></prominent-img>

_**Main topics:** Psychology, social psychology._

This groundbreaking work, voted one of the top ten books of 2010 by VegNews Magazine, offers an absorbing look at why and how humans can so wholeheartedly devote themselves to certain animals and then allow others to suffer needlessly, especially those slaughtered for consumption.

Social psychologist Melanie Joy explores the many ways we numb ourselves and disconnect from our natural empathy for farmed animals. She coins the term "carnism" to describe the belief system that has conditioned us to eat certain animals and not others.

Controversial and challenging, this book will change the way you think about food forever.

## Meatonomics: The Bizarre Economics of Meat and Dairy

_by David Robinson Simon_

<prominent-img src="forever-changed/meatonomics" alt="Meatonomics: The Bizarre Economics of Meat and Dairy by David Robinson Simon - Books To Help You Stay Vegan for Life"></prominent-img>

_**Main topics:** Economics, animal agriculture._

The first book to explore the unseen economic forces that drive our animal food system, and the strange ways these forces affect our spending, eating, health, prosperity, and longevity.

Among other things, consumers have largely lost the ability to decide for ourselves what—and how much—to eat. Instead, those decisions are made for us by meat and dairy producers who control our buying choices with artificially low prices, misleading messaging, and heavy control over legislation and regulation.

Learn what makes this bizarre system tick and how it can be fixed in this fascinating book.

Recommended for anyone wanting to know more about how these huge industries affect our lives, or anyone into finance or economics.

## Beyond Beliefs: A Guide to Improving Relationships and Communication for Vegans, Vegetarians, and Meat Eaters

_by Melanie Joy, PhD_

<prominent-img src="forever-changed/beyondbeliefs" alt="Beyond Beliefs: A Guide to Improving Relationships and Communication for Vegans, Vegetarians, and Meat Eaters by Melanie Joy, PhD - Books To Help You Stay Vegan for Life"></prominent-img>

_**Main topics:** Psychology, relationships._

Many vegans can become frustrated and struggle to feel connected with meat eaters, and meat eaters can feel disconnected from vegans and vegetarians whose beliefs they don't fully understand and whose frustration may spill over into their interactions.

The good news is that relationship and communication breakdown among vegans and meat eaters is not inevitable, and it is reversible.

Recommended for anyone living with or in close relationships with non-vegans.
