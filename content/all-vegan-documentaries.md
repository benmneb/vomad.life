> This page might take a minute to load because there are trailers for every film embedded here.

This list contains only feature-length or TV documentaries that are directly related to veganism - not clips originating from YouTubers or internet-famous speeches.

There are a lot of popular films out there that allude to veganism with their themes but do not actually mention it or promote it.

These films are **not** included here.

Because everyone knows it's cool to come first, I have listed these films here in **chronological order by their original release date**.

_WARNING: Some of the following embedded videos include very graphic footage._

At the time of making this it is the most comprehensive list like this available online.

## Food Chains \[2014]

[IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2141739/?ref_=nv_sr_1) | [Official Website](http://www.foodchainsfilm.com/)

<youtube id="-k4c6QdCJi4"></youtube>

There is so much interest in food these days yet there is almost no interest in the hands that pick that food. While the legal restrictions which kept people bound to farms, like slavery, have been abolished, exploitation still exists, ranging from wage theft to modern-day slavery. These days, this exploitation is perpetuated by the corporations at the top of the food chain: supermarkets. Their buying power has kept wages pitifully low and has created a scenario where desperately poor people are willing to put up with anything to keep their jobs.
