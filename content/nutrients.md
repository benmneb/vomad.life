One of the most common excuses animal-eaters give as to why they "could never go vegan" is that it's **not healthy**.

At first, this might sound like a plausible rationale for supporting the exploitation and abuse of nonhuman animals.

No one wants to harm innocent animals, right? But if we need to in order to get all the nutrients we need, then it's okay, right?

Fortunately for the trillions of innocent animals slaughtered for food every year, that is just not true.

Which is why the major dietetics and nutrition organizations in the world - the people qualified to make such statements - agree that **vegan and vegetarian diets can be just as healthy as standard omnivorous diets**.

But don't take my word for it, read on for what they have to say about the nutritional adequacy of strictly plant-based diets.
