This post is not my opinion.

It is based on data collected from a large international survey we at Vomad conducted a few months ago.

Our [2019 Global Vegan Survey](/survey/2019/TODO?) of almost 13,000 vegans from 97 different countries showed that more people became vegan as a result of watching documentaries than by any other means.

> The dynamic duo of logic and emotion is precisely the required combination to form [the most persuasive argument](/TODO) a human-being can be exposed to. This is just one reason why feature length documentaries topped the list, because they are designed to achieve this potent mix with surgical precision.

In fact, **2,808 people** said the first thing that made them seriously consider being vegan was watching a documentary.

No matter if your friends and family are already thinking about going vegan or are completely new to the subject, sitting down with them to enjoy a well made film like all of those listed below is an excellent way to plant seeds of compassion and inspire them to do the right thing.

Here are the official **Most Influential Vegan Documentaries** for 2019, in order of popularity as chosen by the 12,814 participants of the 2019 Global Vegan Survey.
