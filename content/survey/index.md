The original incentive for conducting this large international survey was to see the most common motivation for people to become vegan, thinking that this would help vegan activists be more effective in their work. However, as the results below make clear, the survey ended up answering, and raising, many other interesting questions about the growing vegan movement.

[Our previous survey](/survey/2016) was taken by only 726 people in 2016 and was restricted in size partly because we limited the responses to those in Australia. This time we wanted to see how the responses from a larger international data-base would compare, so we did it in with the goal of getting a more global response.

This survey was initially shared on the 18th of October 2018 via email to all the members of the Vomad Insider Community. We then shared it publicly on the [Vomad Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/VomadLife/) a few days later, as well as on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vomad.life/). The last response came on the 30th of December 2018 or 73 days later, on the last day of the year.

In total there was **12,814** participants from 97 different countries - or an average of 175 people completing the survey every day it was live - which is almost 20x the number of responses as our last survey from three years ago.

> Topics covered in the 2019 Global Vegan Survey include why and how people became vegan, their primary internal motivations as well as how they actually went about it, and, in terms of actually turning people vegan, which documentaries, books, social media posts, online videos, blogs, print magazines, public speakers and other forms of activism were the most influential.

Before you start reading these results and more just below, you should know that we encourage everyone to not only scroll through the stats and think about what they mean, but also to share your thoughts and interpretations with us in the comments at the bottom. It was due to critical feedback from the last survey that allowed us to make this one better.

This survey was designed to dig deep and isolate the core motivations responsible for making people seriously consider choosing a vegan lifestyle, however, The 2019 Global Vegan Survey ended up as something much greater that will hopefully help activists, organisations and the vegan community at large continue to advocate for veganism in the most effective way we know how to.

A summary of the survey results can be found at the [end of the article](#summary).

## Notes, potential biases and future refinements

The creators of this survey (VomadLife.com / Vomad.Life) are no in way affiliated with any other individuals or organisations mentioned in the survey.

This survey is biased towards English language speakers, as the survey was only shared in English. This could help further explain why 75% of all survey participants came from Australia, the UK, the US, Canada and New Zealand.

While Australia undoubtedly has some very committed and influential vegan activists, more survey participants were Australian than any other nationality (22.5%) which could further explain any trend in popularity towards Australian vegan activists.

Any bias towards online methods of activism could be explained by the fact that survey was conducted online and shared almost exclusively through social media.

See [my notes here](/public-activism) for a thorough discussion on the apparent lack of effectiveness of public activism represented in this survey (1.4% of participants first seriously considered going vegan a result of public activism).

The gap in gender (80% of participants were female) could be an exaggerated percentage for two reasons. Firstly, the survey was shared almost exclusively through social media and [women do appear to use all social media more than men do](https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/men-vs-women-active-social-media/). Secondly, of all the people on the internet, [83% of women and 75% of men use Facebook](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/facebook-statistics/), which was the main platform this survey was shared on.

It's worth noting that the main age group of survey participants was between 18 and 34 years old (56.9% of participants), which correlates with [the main age groups of social media users in general](https://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/).

In the next survey we conduct, the wording of multiple questions will be improved for clarity, we will try to remove any suggestions to possible future answers in questions, we will try to avoid naming organisations to avoid influencing responses and the project will be larger in scope and reach.
