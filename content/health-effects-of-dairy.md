This article is a response to some incomplete and misleading claims made in an article published by ABC Australia titled “[Almond, soy or coconut? How plant-based milks compare to regular dairy](https://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2019-02-09/almond-soy-coconut-milk-and-how-they-compare/10793040)."

With headings like "Milk that's real milk", the ABC article opening paragraphs seemed more like an advert for dairy than anything else. It features quotes from dieticians promoting the 'health benefits' of dairy and assuring everyone that there is nothing wrong with consuming it, while totally ignoring all the disease-causing harmful effects of it.

> “Cow's milk has been a staple of Western diets for thousands of years and is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, particularly calcium" ... "Milk plays an important role in bone health."
>
> \- Nicole Dynan, DAA spokeswoman

The article was published in February this year, just conveniently and perfectly timed for [Februdairy](https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-42990941), a month-long campaign created by dairy farmers encouraging people to drink more milk as a response for the ever-growing vegan movement and the record-breaking sign-ups for [Veganuary](https://veganuary.com).

The re-occurrence of these dishonest stories are emerging more and more in mainstream media since the rise of veganism in Australia and they all seem to be written to mainly "educate" the public about how "[dangerous veganism is](/dangers-of-veganism)" and how "nutritional" animal products are for us - either overlooking or contradicting the conclusions of many solid scientific studies linking animal products to chronic diseases and advising us of doing just the opposite of what The ABC and their chosen experts are promoting.

## Let's Explore Some Real Facts About Dairy Backed by Modern Science

Dairy products are one of the top dietary sources of [saturated fat](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/2016/12/19/saturated-fat-regardless-of-type-found-linked-with-increased-heart-disease-risk/). A huge study of [over 100,000 people](https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5796) published in the British Medical Journal in 2016 found that saturated fats are linked with increased heart disease risk - and heart disease is already the leading cause of death both in Australia and globally.

As the _Physician Committee of Responsible Medicine_ points out on their [website](https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-information/health-concerns-about-dairy):

_"Milk products also contain cholesterol. Diets high in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol increase the risk of heart disease, which remains America's top killer. Cheese is especially dangerous. Typical cheeses are 70 Percent fat."_

Heart disease is also Australia's top killer.

> "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in Australia, with 43,477 deaths attributed to CVD in Australia in 2017. Cardiovascular disease kills one Australian every 12 minutes."

Meat and Dairy products have also been proven time and time again to be a contributor to [Alzheimer's disease](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/alzheimers-disease/) and [type 2 diabetes](https://nutritionstudies.org/the-cheese-trap-fighting-diabetes-with-a-dairy-free-diet/) (the third and seventh leading causes of deaths in Australia respectively).

What the media doesn't seem to be interested in letting you know is that dairy products contain micronutrients and several bioactive constituents that are full of estrogens that not only cause hormonal imbalances but also may influence [cancer risk and progression](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51761601_Milk_Stimulates_Growth_of_Prostate_Cancer_Cells_in_Culture). Studies have also linked dairy to an increased risk of breast, ovarian and especially [prostate cancers](https://nutritionfacts.org/2015/02/17/organic-milk-and-prostate-cancer/).

## More Frightening Facts about Dairy

<prominent-img src="health-effects-of-dairy/ditch-dairy" alt="The Cold Truth about Dairy the Media Don't Want to Spill" caption="Hundreds of responsible physicians protesting outside the White House and urging people to ditch dairy for better health."></prominent-img>

Since the media have conveniently overlooked the countless studies showing how harmful dairy is, I’ve included 11 more frighting facts about dairy (Most of these facts listed were taken from [an article published by Dr Thomas Campbell](https://nutritionstudies.org/12-frightening-facts-milk/) from the Centre of Nutrition Studies) with linked independent studies supporting each claim.

1. A large population cohort study in Sweden \[that followed more than 100,000 people for 20 years] found that women consuming more than 3 glasses of milk a day had almost twice the mortality over 20 years compared to those women consuming less than one glass a day. In addition, high milk-drinkers did not have improved bone health. In fact, [they had more fractures](https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6015), particularly hip fractures.
1. A 2015 systemic review and a meta-analysis of cohort studies found that men with high intakes of dairy (including milk, low-fat milk and cheese, but not non-dairy products) had an [increased risk of prostate cancer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527754).
1. Observational cohort studies have shown [higher dairy intake is linked to higher ovarian cancer risk](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/89/5/1638S/4596954).
1. Cow’s milk protein may [play a role in triggering type 1 diabetes](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/14/11/1081) through a process called molecular mimicry.
1. Across countries, populations that consume more dairy have [higher rates of multiple sclerosis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1291895).
1. Studies found that [dairy protein has been shown to increase IGF-1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7884538) (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1) levels. Increased levels of IGF-1 has now been [implicated in several cancers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51112993_Diet_insulin-like_growth_factor-1_and_cancer_risk).
1. In interventional human experiments, dairy protein has been shown to [promote increased cholesterol levels](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2007.10719646).
1. The primary milk protein (casein) [promotes cancer](https://academic.oup.com/carcin/article-abstract/13/9/1607/293310?redirectedFrom=fulltext) initiated by a carcinogen in experimental animal studies.
1. Higher milk intake is linked to [acne](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-4632.2009.04002.x).
1. Milk intake has been implicated in [constipation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2823764/) and [ear infections](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/89/5/1638S/4596954).
1. Milk perhaps is the most common self-reported food allergen in the world. [Most of the world's population cannot adequately digest milk due to lactose intolerance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674907009918).

> [Approximately 65 percent of the human population are lactose intolerant](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lactose-intolerance#statistics). Don't you think it's wrong that dieticians and government recommendations define a healthy diet as one that includes a product that most of their people are genetically intolerant to?

## You may ask "but where the hell can I get all these essential nutrients that the ABC has told me I need to get from Dairy?"

Well, you are in luck, because all the nutrients in dairy that they're so hyped to tell us about can actually be obtained from plants without the extra disease-causing baggage dairy products come with.

> An appropriately planned vegan diet can meet all your nutrient needs at any stage of life including when you are pregnant, breastfeeding or for older adults and athletes.

The statement above is not my opinion but is the peer-reviewed position of the largest dieticians organisation in the world with over 100,000 credentialed practitioners, the [Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704/).

It is also the position of all the major dieticians' organisations around the world including [The Dietitians Association of Australia](https://daa.asn.au/smart-eating-for-you/smart-eating-fast-facts/healthy-eating/vegan-diets-facts-tips-and-considerations/), [Dietitians of Canada](https://www.dietitians.ca/Downloads/Factsheets/Guidlines-for-Vegans.aspx), [The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx) and [The British Nutrition Foundation](https://www.nutrition.org.uk/bnf-publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition). Click the links to see for yourself. See [this post](/nutrients) for more.

Just because dairy contains protein and calcium, it doesn’t change that fact it also contains trans fats, casomorphin and addictive substances, and more harmful things that literally cause our leading diseases and illnesses.

And speaking of addictive substances in dairy... If you consume dairy products, then [you are probably also addicted to this food and don't even know it](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2009576145951583!)

## One more important thing...

The one fact that matters the most when it comes to health in which the media and many other "experts" don't seem to be interested in letting anyone know about is that **the only diet that has ever been proven in the laboratory to not only PREVENT and ARREST coronary heart disease but even REVERSE it is a low-fat whole food plant-based diet**.

> "Despite recent improvements, it remains one of the biggest burdens on our economy. CVD [heart disease] affects more than 3.7 million Australians. 1.4 million people are prevented from living a full life because of CVD related disability."

But don't take my word for it, I'll let this 104-year-old passionate surgeon tell you about it in this short one and a half minute clip...

## And let's not forget about the animals and the planet!

Last but not least, avoiding dairy products does not only reduce our risk of developing harmful chronic diseases but it also eliminates unnecessary suffering to billions of sentient beings and helps to a great extent in solving the environmental issues we're all facing today.

While Dr Crowe apparently thinks that "there is no real reason to change our habits anytime soon", scientists, environmentalists, NASA and the United Nations are publishing study after study urging us to do just the opposite.

The latest of which is a [5-year study](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987?fbclid=IwAR2fL4jO2D8ANwpvsBqVr62LqnLYNg8tCcUqKfU_ZMSN0KY16DU258LYhLA) by _Oxford University_ released in 2018 and is considered the most comprehensive study ever conducted exploring the relationship between food production, land use and the environment.

The study has found that all kinds of meat and dairy productions are harmful to the living world than growing plant protein. The findings of the study show that animal farming takes up 83% of the world’s agricultural land, but delivers only 18% of our calories. While eating a vegan diet cuts the use of land by 76% and halves the greenhouse gases and other pollution caused by food production.

It was summarised at the end of the study that the single biggest way to reduce your impact on the environment is to live a vegan lifestyle - that is a lifestyle completely devoid of all meat and dairy products.

To learn more about how your milk is produced and the unnecessary inflicting of pain and suffering it causes, then I recommend watching this short youtube clip called [Dairy is Scary: The Industry Explained in 5 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcN7SGGoCNI).

To learn more about the impact of dairy and other animal products on the environment, land use and resources, I recommend watching [Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret](https://www.cowspiracy.com/facts) (available on Netflix now).

If you feel like these studies I provided (linked above and listed below at the end of the blog) are too much for you to read, then you are in luck because the amazing Dr Michael Greger and his team at [NutritionFacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org/) (an independent non-for profit organisation) work around the clock going through thousands of studies and summarising them for people like us in short informative bite-sized videos such as these [19 short videos](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/dairy/) explaining how “nutritional" dairy is really for us.

Here's one of these videos burying the old myth Ms Dynan was quoted as saying "milk plays an important role for our bone health".
